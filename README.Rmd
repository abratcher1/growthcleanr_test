R package for cleaning data from Electronic Health Record systems, focused on
cleaning height and weight measurements.

<a name="cite"></a>
This package implements the
[Daymont et al. algorithm](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/24/6/1080/3767271),
as specified in Supplemental File 3 within the
[Supplementary Material](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/24/6/1080/3767271#97610899)
published with that paper.

This package also includes an R version of the
[SAS macro published by the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpao/growthcharts/resources/sas.htm)
for calculating percentiles and Z-scores of pediatric growth observations and
utilities for working with both functions. As of spring 2021, it also supports
cleaning anthropometric measurements for adults up to age 65.

## Summary

The `growthcleanr` package processes data prepared in a specific format to identify
biologically implausible height and weight measurements. It bases these evaluations on
techniques which use patient-specific longitudinal analysis and variations from
published growth trajectory charts for pediatric subjects. These techniques are
performed in a specific order which refines and improves results throughout the
process.

Results from `growthcleanr` include a flag for each measurement indicating whether it
is to be included or excluded based on plausibility, with a variety of specific types
of exclusions identified distinctly. These flags can be analyzed further by researchers
studying anthropometric EHR data to determine which measurements to include or exclude
in their own studies. No values are deleted or otherwise removed; each is only flagged
in a new column.

To start running `growthcleanr`, an R installation with a variety of additional
packages is required, as is a growth measurement dataset prepared for use in
`growthcleanr`.
