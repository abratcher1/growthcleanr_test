#' Function for temporary extraneous (step 5):
#' 5.  Temporary extraneous: I use extraneous to refer to more than more than one recorded value for a parameter on the same day,
#'     and we need to select which one to include in our analysis. The overall strategy will be to select a measurement using a simple
#'     strategy that will be used temporarily, and select permanently in a later step after we have a somewhat cleaner dataset that
#'     can help us identify the best extraneous.
#' a.  For subjects/parameters with extraneous: Determine median_tbc*sd for both parameters: the median tbc*sd for each subject
#'     and parameter including only non-extraneous values with exc_*==0. The median of the same parameter as the extraneous will
#'     be referred to as median_tbc*sd, the median of the other parameter will be referred to as median_tbcOsd.
#' b.	For each subject/parameter with extraneous and at least one value for the subject/parameter on a day with no extraneous,
#'     select the value closest to the median_tbc*sd for temporary inclusion, and assign all other extraneous exc_*=2.
#'  i.	For each subject/parameter with extraneous and no values for the subject/parameter on a day with no extraneous, select the
#'     value closest to the median_tbcOsd for temporary inclusion, and assign all other extraneous exc_*=2.
#'     If median_tbcOsd is missing because there are no values for the other parameter, randomly choose one extraneous value for
#'     each subject/parameter/age to keep as exc_*=0 and replace exc_*=2 for all other extraneous for that subject/parameter/age.
