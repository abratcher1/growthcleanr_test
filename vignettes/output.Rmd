As seen in the [Usage example](usage.html), `growthcleanr` creates a vector of
flags identifying which measurements should be included or excluded, and why.
This vector can be added to the original dataset for further review. The flags
`growthcleanr` sets are text labels, most of which are descriptive. The text
does not always map directly back to the precise step in the algorithm.

## Exclusions generated by pediatric algorithm

For convenience, the following table maps which algorithm steps in the pediatric
algorithm, as defined by Supplemental File 3 within the
[Supplementary Material](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/24/6/1080/3767271#97610899)
of the Daymont et al. paper, define exclusions in the algorithm by the exclusion
identifier also prescribed in the algorithm ("`algorithm exc id`"). The
`exclusion type` column identifies the text of the exclusion flag set by
`growthcleanr`. The `notes` column at right identifies minor discrepancies
between the algorithm's step labels and labels used in comment text in
`growthcleanr`.

A researcher wanting to compare two datasets -- for example, one including only
measurements `growthcleanr` flags for inclusion, and a second which also
includes carried forward values -- could extract only measurements where the
flag is set to "`Include`" for the first set and either "`Include`" or
"`Exclude-Carried-Forward`" for the second set. This flexibility gives each
researcher control over how to incorporate growthcleanr results into their own
research.

## Exclusions generated by adult algorithm

For the adult algorithm, the following exclusions apply. Note that a few types
are described with the same exclusion codes. While formal publication of the
adult algorithm is in progress, a detailed narrative describing the algorithm is
available at [Adult algorithm](adult-algorithm.html).
