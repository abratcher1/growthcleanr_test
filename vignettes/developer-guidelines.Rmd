## CRAN Release Checklist

When deploying updates to CRAN, here a few updates that you need to check off before doing so:

- Update version number in DESCRIPTION in format major.minor.patch (e.g. 1.2.1)
- Update documentation with `devtools::document()`
- Run `devtools::check()`:
  - If any problems come up that have not previously been documented in `cran-comments.md` and cannot be fixed, fix them. There should be no ERRORs or WARNINGs before submitting to CRAN.
  - Look through past CRAN submissions to make sure you haven't reintroduced a bug/note that has been addressed in a previous version
- Update NEWS.md with version updates
- Update cran-comments.md in format
- After the branch is merged, create a GitHub release
- After the branch is merged, submit to CRAN with previously written comments!
